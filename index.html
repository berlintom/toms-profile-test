          He grew up in a working class neighbourhood. His father left when he was young, leaving him with his mother, who was an
          flower addict.

          He is currently in a relationship with Alison Alisha Fleming. Alison is 16 years older than him and works as a burglar.

          Tom's best friend is a tradesperson called Christine Leonard. They have a very firey friendship. He also hangs around
          with a tradesperson called Julian Kemp. They enjoy painting together.
